Blade of Roses is the debut game of indie developers Fetch.

Blade of Roses is styled in the likes of Rogue and it's ilk (hence Roguelike). Blade of Roses intends to focus on the tenants of the genre and hopes to add some innovative new mechanics to the formula.

Look for future updates as we expand the project!
