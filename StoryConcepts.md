Some say this would not have happened were there still Heroes in this world, bu the time of Hereos is long faded into history and myth.<br>

Not long ago he came wrapped in chains and his face but a mask of anger. None stood in his path as he burned a bloody trail to the throne. There he slew the king and began his rule. Now the world is restless, evil has returnedto the realm.The stories of the time of heroes are but painful memories of a lost day. It is into this world that babes come crying and mothers hopes are lost in the night. It is in this world we strive for Heroes to return...<br>

Your birth, while unmiraculuos, has brought you into an extraordinary time. The time of Heroes is passed and an evil grips the land. Beasts of hunger and rage have left the people weak and afraid. This is not a time of joy or prosperity but the beginning of a fading world. In this time of your birth one man is known to have brought this fate upon us all. A Chained Man... Stories speak of timeslong lost where the world faced such terrors and in those times a Hero rose from the gloom to save the world. It is in with your birth that this world regains some faint hope for perhaps it is you that will bring about the return of the Heroes...<br>
